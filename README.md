# ShaperPaper


The original idea was to photocopy 54 sheets of 8.5x11 paper with 3-4 lines of shaper tape on them. that would give me the ability to cover a 4x8 sheet. 

**That did work. try it for yourself.**

This method shouldn't require the use of tape though. that's my goal.

You can try the pre-made `cheap_tape.pdf` if you want. No promises whether or not it'll work for you... 

customize it with Processing.org 3+ and `ShaperPaper.pde`.

---
I made the processing sketch because I had problems tracking because I reused tape in the same Origin scan. 

I haven't done a lot of testing. By that I mean *zero* testing. I just carefully measured the original Shaper Tape after my Origin arrived.

Once I get somemore time I'll make sure it really tracks. Feel free to modify and make PRs

## How To

**Print pdf from a regular printer**

**Use tape or spray adhesive to get all four corners of the page secured.**
    
* Maybe do all edges to prevent Origin from ripping them.
